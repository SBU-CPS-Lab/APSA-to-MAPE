   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (1) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=EAST ZONE is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=WEST ZONE is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: Calculated Heating Design Air Flow Rate for System=EAST ZONE AIR SYSTEM is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: Calculated Heating Design Air Flow Rate for System=WEST ZONE AIR SYSTEM is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** SizeWaterCoil: Coil="EAST ZONE CW COOLING COIL", Cooling Coil has leaving humidity ratio > entering humidity ratio.
   **   ~~~   **     Wair,in =  8.405078E-003 [kgWater/kgDryAir]
   **   ~~~   **     Wair,out = 9.000000E-003 [kgWater/kgDryAir]
   **   ~~~   ** ....coil leaving humidity ratio will be reset to:
